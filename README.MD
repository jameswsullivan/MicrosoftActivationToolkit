# Microsoft Activation Toolkit


## Summary

- This project is written in C# as a Windows Forms App.
- This tool is a GUI that runs `slmgr.vbs` and `ospp.vbs` commands with `cscript` and mimics a console output which displays the results.
- This tool requires Elevated Privilege to function properly.


## To-Dos in future updates

- Implement INFO and ERROR logging.
- Add icon to MainForm.
- Fine tune element focus and tab order on start-up.
